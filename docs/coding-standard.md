## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

This document defines the C# coding conventions used at Sabre Rail Services Ltd. These standards are derived from Microsoft's recommended practices and adapted for internal use.

### Goals

* Ensure consistent code formatting.
* Improve readability and maintainability.
* Facilitate collaboration across development teams.
* Support best practices in modern C# development.

---

## 2. Layout Conventions

* Use four-space indentation (tabs saved as spaces).
* One statement and one declaration per line.
* Break lines longer than 90 characters.
* Use parentheses in expressions for clarity.
* Add blank lines between method and property definitions.
* Organize code blocks with vertical spacing for readability.

```csharp
if ((value1 > value2) && (value1 > value3))
{
    // Take appropriate action.
}
```

---

## 3. Naming Conventions

### Capitalization Styles

* **PascalCase**:

  * Class, record, struct, interface names
  * Method and property names
  * Enum types and members
* **camelCase**:

  * Parameters and local variables
  * Private fields (prefixed with `_`)
* **Prefix Conventions**:

  * Static fields: `s_`
  * Thread-static fields: `t_`

### Acronyms

* Two-letter acronyms: all uppercase (e.g., `IOStream`)
* Longer acronyms: capitalize only first letter (e.g., `XmlReader`)

### Enums

* Use singular names unless marked with `[Flags]`
* Use PascalCase for members
* Do not prefix enum values with the enum type

```csharp
public enum Color
{
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
}

[Flags]
public enum FileAccess
{
    Read = 1,
    Write = 2,
    Execute = 4
}
```

---

## 4. Commenting Conventions

* Use full sentences with proper punctuation.
* Place comments above the relevant code.
* Avoid decorative comment blocks.
* Use XML documentation for public members.

```csharp
// Calculates the total cost including tax.
public decimal CalculateTotal(decimal amount, decimal taxRate)
```

---

## 5. Language Guidelines

### Strings

* Use string interpolation:

```csharp
string message = $"Hello, {name}";
```

* Use `StringBuilder` for concatenation in loops.

### var Usage

* Use `var` when the type is obvious:

```csharp
var count = 42;
```

* Use explicit types when clarity is needed:

```csharp
int total = CalculateTotal();
```

### Arrays

```csharp
string[] vowels = { "a", "e", "i", "o", "u" };
```

### Delegates

* Use `Func<>` and `Action<>` instead of custom delegate types.

### Whitespace

* Use whitespace to separate logical blocks and improve readability.
* Align similar lines of code vertically where appropriate.

---

## 6. Program.cs and Startup Conventions

Structure the `Program.cs` file using logical sections with comments:

```csharp
// 1. Configuration
// 2. Authentication
// 3. Authorization
// 4. HttpClient
// 5. Event Store
// 6. Services
// 7. Swagger
// 8. CORS
// 9. Migrations
```

* Consider extracting setup into extension methods for clarity.

---

## 7. Swagger and API Documentation

* Use `AddSwaggerGen()` to register Swagger.
* Define JWT bearer token scheme:

```csharp
c.AddSecurityDefinition("Bearer", new OpenApiSecurityScheme {
    Name = "Authorization",
    Type = SecuritySchemeType.Http,
    Scheme = "Bearer",
    In = ParameterLocation.Header,
    Description = "Enter JWT as: Bearer {your_token}"
});
```

* Read server URL from configuration for Docker support.

---

## 8. Database Initialization and Migrations

* Use `CreateScope()` to get scoped services.
* Catch and log exceptions during migration.
* Use raw SQL with care for custom migrations.

```csharp
await store.Storage.ApplyAllConfiguredChangesToDatabaseAsync();
```

---

## 9. Development-Time HTTP Clients

* For SSL bypass in development:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("NoSSL")
    .ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(() =>
        new HttpClientHandler {
            ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (_, _, _, _) => true
        });
```

* Clearly label this as **not for production**.
* Wrap registration in development environment checks.

---

## 10. EditorConfig Usage

* Use `.editorconfig` to enforce style rules project-wide.
* Specify naming conventions, indentation, newline preferences, etc.
* Ensure IDEs and editors are configured to respect `.editorconfig` settings.

Example:

```ini
[*.cs]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
csharp_new_line_before_open_brace = all
csharp_style_var_for_built_in_types = true:suggestion
csharp_style_var_elsewhere = false:suggestion
```
